# KBbot
Parses zkillboard to give an hour by hour feed of kills by a corporation or alliance.

The configuration file is pretty self explanatory, you'll need to populate it with your corp or alliance's details.

You will need to make an Incoming Hook for the slack channel you want to post to. Go to Configure Integrations > Incoming WebHooks > Setup a hook and grab the Webhook URL

This is to be considered alpha software. Please report any bugs you run into on github. If you are reporting a bug, please run the script with -d and send me the output.

Be sure to run the script manually one time once your config file is setup. This will validate your configuration and initialize some stored variables.

All ISK donations are welcome. 

Thanks!
